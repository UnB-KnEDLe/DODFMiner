The project “KnEDLe - Knowledge Extraction from Documents of Legal content” is a partnership among FAPDF (Fundação de Apoio à Pesquisa do Distrito Federal), UnB (the University of Brasília) and Finatec (Fundação de Empreendimentos Científicos e Tecnológicos), sponsored by FAPDF. This project was proposed in order to employ official publications as a research object and to extract knowledge. The objective is to develop intelligent tools for extracting structured information from such publications, aiming to facilitate the search and retrieval of information, increasing government transparency and facilitating audit tasks and detecting problems related to the use of public resources.
